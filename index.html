            <p> A unique idea of having 56 shops each serving different variety of food. Like we have chappan bhog for the gods this is for us. The kachoris are a must have here you cannot just miss them and the rest of the fare was also decent </p>

        <p>3 Idiots is the perfect end to an exciting year for India: the year when the aam aadmi voted in progress, liberalism, secularism and turned his back to corruption, communalism, regionalism. The three idiots, Rancchoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad (Aamir Khan), Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) and Farhan Qureshi (R Madhavan), are perfect archetypes of the new age Indian who is essentially a non-conformist, questioning outmoded givens, choosing to live life on his own terms and chartering new roads that consciously skirt the rat race. Of course, they begin on the beaten track -- due to societal/parental pressure -- but refuse to become cogs in the wheel. Naturally, they end up as the Frostian hero (Robert Frost's Road Not Taken) who made all the difference to his life, and the world, by taking the road less travelled by.</p>

        <p>Visually appealing and well made horror comedy . Story was simple and predictable , but these kinda concept is new to Bollywood and Indian cinema . Comedy worked well and never felt over the top in any place , especially Abhishek Banerjee did great . Screenplay was bit slow , similar to Stree kinda pace . Main positive was breathe taking visuals , cinematography was great , terrific VFXs and CGI , and 3D effect literally lifted up the whole experience . Music and songs were good . Cast did their job well . Overall , visually delivered a Hollywood experience and good entertainer to watch . Don't miss it to watch it on Big screen .</p>
